FAQ Question

What are the LJ-specific tags?

There are 5 LJ-specific markup tags, for use in some of the places where HTML is allowed: 

1. <lj user="username"> 

... where "username" can be the username of any LiveJournal user. This is
    displayed as a bold link to the journal, with a 'head' icon that links to
    the profile page (User Info). 

2. <lj comm="community"> 

... where "community" can be the username of any LiveJournal community. This is
    displayed as a bold link to the community, with a 'compass' icon that links
    to the profile page (Community Info). 

3. <lj-cut> ... </lj-cut> 

... which can be used in a journal entry to hide part of, or all of an entry.
    When the entry appears in your journal or on someone's Friends page,
    everything after an <lj-cut> tag and before a closing </lj-cut> tag will be
    replaced by a link to the Read Comments page. The Read Comments page always
    displays the entire entry as well as any comments made on it. When the
    <lj-cut> is closed with </lj-cut>, any text placed after the closing
    </lj-cut> tag will also display on the journal, instead of just on the Read
    Comments page. 

    By default, the link will say "Read more", but if you want it to say
    something else like "Cut off here", you can write the tag as <lj-cut
    text="Cut off here"> 

4. <lj-poll> ... </lj-poll> 

... which members with Paid status can use to include a poll in a journal
    entry. For more information on polls see:
    (http://www.livejournal.com/support/faqbrowse.bml?faqid=69). 


5. <lj-raw> ... </lj-raw> 

... which disables the auto-insertion of line breaks on sections of your post.
    This provides the same functionality as the "Don't auto-format" checkbox,
    but can be used to only stop auto-formatting on a section of your post,
    instead of the entire post. For more information on "Don't auto-format", go

Additionally, there are 3 LJ-specific URL forms that will only work when posted on a journal held on the LiveJournal.com servers : 

<a href="lj://user/news">The News Journal</a> will make a link to news 

<a href="lj://support/3777">Support Request #3777</a> will make a link to the 3777th support request, and 

<a href="lj://faq/64">FAQ #64</a> will take you the 64th FAQ, on the LiveJournal servers ( http://www.livejournal.com/support/faq.bml )
